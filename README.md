## 📌 Overview

The Shopper Behavior Intelligence System is an explainable AI framework designed to analyze customer purchasing behavior, uncover cross-category affinities, and generate actionable insights for merchandising and marketing teams.

Unlike traditional recommendation systems, this solution focuses on behavioral segmentation, interpretability, and business impact rather than just predictions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms collect large volumes of transactional data but lack structured behavioral intelligence to understand:

Why customers purchase

How segments differ in preferences

Which categories show cross-affinity

How purchasing behavior impacts merchandising decisions

This project transforms raw retail data into strategic decision intelligence.

## 🧠 Solution Architecture

Data Layer
→ Feature Engineering
→ Behavioral Segmentation (Clustering)
→ Affinity Mining (Association Rules)
→ Segment Profiling
→ Business Insight Generation

## 🔬 Core Components
1️⃣ Customer Segmentation

Feature Engineering:

Purchase Frequency

Total Spend (Monetary)

Average Rating

Category Diversity

Clustering Algorithm: K-Means

Evaluation Metric: Silhouette Score

Outcome: Distinct shopper personas with measurable behavioral traits.

2️⃣ Product Affinity Discovery

Market Basket Analysis

Apriori Algorithm

Association Rule Mining

Metrics:

Support

Confidence

Lift

Outcome: Identification of cross-category attraction patterns.

3️⃣ Segment-Level Insights

Segment × Category Heatmap

Spending distribution analysis

Payment method preference analysis

Purchase frequency behavior

Outcome: Actionable insights for targeted campaigns.

4️⃣ Behavior DNA Framework (Innovation Layer)

Each customer is profiled using:

Price Variation Score

Exploration Index

Average Rating Bias

Spending Intensity

This transforms transactional users into interpretable behavioral personas.
